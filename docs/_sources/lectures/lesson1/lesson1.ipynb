    "Data analytics is the field that includes various methods of data exploration. Any kind of information can undergo data analytics to extract insights that can drive improvements. These techniques can uncover trends and metrics that might otherwise be obscured within large datasets. Such insights can then be utilized to optimize processes, enhancing the overall efficiency of a business or system. There are four types of data analytics, each are in their own respective level of value and complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Descriptive Analytics\n",
    "Descriptive analytics focuses on summarizing historical data to understand what has happened over a given period. It uses data aggregation and data mining techniques to provide insights into past performance and trends. By creating reports, dashboards, and scorecards, descriptive analytics helps organizations understand their current status and how they got there. This form of analytics is foundational, as it provides the context and baseline information necessary for more advanced types of analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diagnostic Analytics\n",
    "Diagnostic analytics goes a step further by examining data to determine the causes of past outcomes. It delves into the details of descriptive analytics to uncover why certain events occurred. Techniques such as drill-down, data discovery, data mining, and correlations are used to identify patterns and relationships. This type of analytics helps organizations understand the underlying reasons behind trends and anomalies, providing a deeper insight into the factors influencing their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predictive Analytics\n",
    "Predictive analytics uses statistical models and machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and make forecasts about future events. By identifying patterns and trends from past data, predictive analytics can estimate the likelihood of future outcomes. This type of analytics is crucial for decision-making, as it allows organizations to anticipate potential challenges and opportunities, helping them to plan and strategize more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prescriptive Analytics\n",
    "Prescriptive analytics goes beyond predicting future outcomes by recommending actions to achieve desired results. It uses optimization and simulation algorithms to suggest the best course of action based on the predicted data. Prescriptive analytics takes into account various constraints and objectives, providing specific guidance on how to address potential issues or capitalize on opportunities. This advanced form of analytics supports decision-making by suggesting actions that can help achieve business goals and improve overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the four types of analytics is crucial for mastering artificial intelligence (AI). Descriptive analytics lays the groundwork by summarizing historical data, providing insights into past trends essential for building predictive models in AI. Diagnostic analytics goes deeper, uncovering the reasons behind trends, which is fundamental in training AI algorithms to recognize patterns and anomalies effectively. Predictive analytics plays a pivotal role by forecasting future outcomes based on historical data, a capability vital for AI systems to make informed decisions and projections. Finally, prescriptive analytics not only predicts future scenarios but also prescribes optimal actions to achieve desired outcomes, guiding AI systems in making proactive and strategic decisions. Together, these analytics types form the backbone of AI learning, equipping developers and researchers with the tools to enhance AI capabilities, optimize performance, and drive innovation across various domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenario:\n",
    "Dr. Jake is a medical doctor and the CEO of Astro JR, a giant pharmaceutical company in the Philippines. To support the production and use of AstroJR's COVID19 vaccine, this company has implemented a number of business intelligence and data analytics tools. Your task is to provide the appropriate and necessary analytical questions Dr. Jake must ask his analytics team in order to provide better deployment and production of COVID19 vaccines around the world using descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Descriptive:** How many infected cases since last week?\n",
    "- **Diagnostic:** What factor affects the demand of AstroJR's COVID19 vaccine?\n",
    "- **Predictive:** How many deaths next week?\n",
    "- **Prescriptive:** If the number of cases will increase next week, how many hospital staff should be here to adequately treat the influx of patients?\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the key questions identified by the analytics team, historical data on deaths will be crucial. By analyzing this time-series data, the team can leverage statistical modeling techniques to uncover patterns and trends that will enable them to generate accurate forecasts. The inclusion of a time variable in the inquiry makes the use of these statistical models essential, as they are specifically designed to handle and extract insights from data with a temporal component. This predictive modeling process will also introduce the team to the potential applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in this domain.\n",

    "| 1940s | Shallow Neural Networks, also known as feedforward neural networks or single-layer neural networks, are a type of artificial neural network with a limited number of layers between the input and output layers. These networks consist of an input layer, one or more hidden layers (though typically just one), and an output layer. However, in shallow networks, the information flows only in one direction, from the input layer to the output layer, without any feedback loops or complex connections. |\n",

Their influential 1986 paper, titled \"Learning Representations by Back-Propagating Errors,\" demonstrated the effectiveness of backpropagation in training multi-layer neural networks for a wide range of tasks.

    "### Computer Vision\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most visible areas is computer vision. Models like convolutional neural networks have allowed machines to \"see\" and interpret images. This is the foundation of facial recognition on our phones, automated quality checks in factories, and even life-saving applications such as detecting tumors from X-ray or MRI scans. A decade ago, this level of accuracy in image recognition seemed far off, yet today it's already part of our everyday lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the area of language and communication, deep learning has transformed how we interact with technology. Natural language processing systems now power machine translation, sentiment analysis, and intelligent assistants. The leap from early, stiff translation tools to fluid and context-aware models like GPT or Google Translate demonstrates just how much deep learning has changed the way machines understand human language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Speech Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "Another breakthrough has been in speech recognition. Tasks that once required specialized systems, like converting spoken words into text, are now accessible on any smartphone. From transcribing meetings to enabling voice-controlled devices, deep learning has made human–computer interaction much more seamless.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Autonomous Vehicles\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning also plays a central role in autonomous systems, particularly self-driving cars. Cars equipped with cameras and sensors rely on neural networks to recognize pedestrians, interpret traffic signs, and make split-second driving decisions. This same principle extends to drones and robots that navigate unpredictable environments without direct human control.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Healthcare and Medicine\n",
    "\n",
    "The field of healthcare has also embraced deep learning in profound ways. Beyond medical imaging, it is being used to predict diseases, assist in drug discovery, and even recommend personalized treatment plans. These tools not only support doctors but also expand access to better healthcare worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommender Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Another familiar application comes from recommender systems. The reason Netflix knows what movie you might want to watch, or why YouTube lines up the next video so perfectly, is because deep learning models study user behavior and adjust recommendations accordingly. While it keeps us entertained, it also demonstrates how powerful these models are in shaping digital experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generative AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there's the creative frontier—generative AI. Tools like GANs and diffusion models allow machines to create new content, from realistic images and videos to music and art. What started as amusing experiments, like the clumsy \"Will Smith eating spaghetti\" video, has now developed into highly convincing media that blurs the line between real and artificial."
