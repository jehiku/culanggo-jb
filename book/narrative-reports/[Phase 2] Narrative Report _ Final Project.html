        This phase centered on gathering and preparing the data required for developing and testing <br>
        the ASL recognition system. Two main datasets were assembled: a static image dataset for model <br>
        training and a custom video dataset for initial testing and validation of data suitability. <br>
        The primary training dataset was sourced from Kaggle, which contained labeled images of American <br>
        Sign Language letters organized into class-specific folders. This structure allowed for consistent <br>
        preprocessing and automatic label assignment. The dataset included minor class imbalances, such as <br>
        the letter t having fewer samples, but these inconsistencies were small and manageable. Since the <br>
        images came from varied lighting conditions and hand positions, they provided a diverse base for <br>
        training and helped support generalization. <br>
        Alongside the Kaggle dataset, the group created a supplemental video dataset intended for testing. <br>
        Each member recorded short clips of themselves spelling their names in ASL, providing a realistic <br>
        sample of how the system might be used in practice. These videos helped evaluate whether the <br>
        training data aligned well with real-world samples. Although this process involved observing how the <br>
        system responded to the recorded gestures, it was conducted only to check the suitability of our <br>
        collected data. It was not part of Phase 3 model experimentation. This early validation was necessary <br>
        because even if a dataset performs well on paper, it may not translate effectively to real-life input. <br>
        The team then observed that the initial recordings did not match well with the visual characteristics of <br>
        the Kaggle images. This led us to revisit how the videos were captured. We repeated recordings using <br>
        clearer backgrounds and minimized arm visibility, since many images in the Kaggle dataset showed <br>
        only the hand. These adjustments were made to ensure that the testing data was consistent and <br>
        properly aligned with the visual patterns learned during training. This process confirmed that dataset <br>
        characteristics played a significant role in model performance, which guided our decision to explore <br>
        additional datasets later on. <br>
        Once the datasets were finalized, a standard preprocessing pipeline was applied. All images and <br>
        extracted video frames were converted to a consistent size and format to ensure compatibility with the <br>
        models to be used in the next phase. Frames from the video recordings were extracted at a fixed rate <br>
        and processed in the same manner as the training images, allowing both datasets to share a uniform <br>
        structure. Labeling was handled automatically through directory organization, enabling reproducible <br>
        and efficient preparation. <br>
        Throughout this process, individual team roles supported the data pipeline. Dela Cruz handled the <br>
        implementation of preprocessing procedures and ensured that the datasets followed a consistent <br>
        structure. Abainza provided equipment and assisted with GPU requirements needed for data <br>
        preparation tasks. Casino oversaw the correctness of the video recordings and ensured that the testing <br>
        samples followed the intended guidelines. I contributed by monitoring the coherence between the <br>
        training and testing datasets, participating in the recording process, and refining documentation to <br>
        maintain a clear and organized report of the procedures. <br>
        Overall, Phase 2 established a complete and well-structured data foundation for the project. The <br>
        combination of standardized static images and carefully prepared video samples ensured that the <br>
